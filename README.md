# Nessus Vulnerability Management

## Introduction
I will demonstrate how to configure Nessus Essentials to perform both basic and credentialed vulnerability scans on our Windows 10 host. This process focuses on securing our networks against critical vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit. By adhering to the six key stages of the Vulnerability Management Process — **Discover**, **Prioritize**, **Assess**, **Report**, **Remediate**, and **Verify** — we will effectively mitigate risks and strengthen our network defenses.

## Setup
First, let's create a Windows 10 virtual machine in Azure. You may do this with VMware, VirtualBox, or AWS.

While setting up the virtual machine, add a new rule in the Network settings to allow all inbound and outbound connections necessary for this demo.

Additionally, I disabled the firewall on the Windows 10 virtual machine and verified connectivity from my host machine to ensure accurate and efficient results.

Next, download Nessus Essentials and install it on the host computer, rather than on our other virtual machine network. Be sure to register for Nessus Essentials.

## 1st Basic Scan
In Nessus, we will run a basic Network scan on our Windows 10 VM (no credentials).

### Results of Our First Scan:

As you can see, these vulnerabilities can vary from low to critical. An “informational vulnerability” is a finding that discloses specific system details or configuration information without presenting a direct security threat or exploitable weakness.

## Getting Ready for the Second Scan
Nessus has guidelines for configuring credentialed scans on Windows hosts not joined to a domain. Begin by enabling the Remote Registry service to allow the scanner to access the computer’s registry.

Disable the notifications in User Account Control Settings.

Finally, add a key to the Registry Editor to further disable User Account Control for the remote account, simplifying the scanning process for the project.

Restart your machine afterward.

## Configuring Credentialed Scan
We will use our credentials for the VM to run a credentialed scan.

Here highlights the significance of running credentialed scans, as they enable the discovery of additional vulnerabilities that would otherwise remain undetected.

Let’s take this a step further by installing deprecated software on our VM to observe the vulnerabilities detected during the scan.

## Setting Up for the Credentialed Scan with Deprecated Software
I will install an old version of Adobe Reader, VLC Player, and Firefox on our VM.

Next, rerun the credentialed scan on our VM to analyze the results after adding the deprecated versions of the software.

As anticipated, the scan identified numerous critical vulnerabilities. Let's move on to the next stage of the Vulnerability Management Process — **Remediate**.

## Remediate
There are several approaches to remediation, ranging from addressing vulnerabilities individually to uninstalling specific software. For this project, I will be uninstalling the outdated versions of the software, running Windows Updates, and updating any applications in the Microsoft Store.

### Remediated Results
After running the credentialed scan again and reviewing the results below, it revealed a significant reduction in the number of vulnerabilities compared to the previous scans.

## Conclusion
In this project, multiple scans were performed with Nessus to evaluate various environments and identify their vulnerabilities. By utilizing the tools available in our Azure VMs, we effectively remediated many of the vulnerabilities discovered in our Windows 10 environment. This highlights the critical need for effective vulnerability management practices.

The Vulnerability Management Process is a systematic approach to identifying, evaluating, treating, and reporting vulnerabilities in an organization's systems and applications. This process helps organizations mitigate risks and protect their assets from potential threats.
